### What is the Difference Between Client and Bot?
Difference between a Client and a Bot:

- **Client**: The Client represents both the application and the Twitch user associated with it.
Essentially, the Client is a mix of the app and its user.

- **Bot**: The Bot extends the functionality of the Client. It allows you to register access tokens of different users.

The tasks that can only be performed by the Client can also be done with the Bot. Additionally,
creating custom events with the Bot **wonâ€™t incur extra costs** for registered users.


## Examples

=== "Client"

    !!! warning
        The provided code is missing the app client secret and user refresh token. Without these components,
        the access token won't be able to regenerate when it expires.

    ```python
    from twitch.ext.oauth import DeviceAuthFlow, Scopes
    from twitch.types import eventsub
    from twitch import Client
    
    client = Client(client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID')
    
    # Setup Device Authentication Flow with necessary scopes.
    # This is required for obtaining user-specific access tokens.
    DeviceAuthFlow(
        client=client,
        scopes=[Scopes.MODERATOR_READ_FOLLOWERS, Scopes.USER_WRITE_CHAT]
    )
    
    @client.event
    async def on_code(code: str):
        """
        Handles the device authorization code event.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        code: str
            The device authorization code sent to the user.
        """
        print(f'Verification URI: https://www.twitch.tv/activate?device-code={code}')
    
    @client.event
    async def on_auth(access_token: str, refresh_token: str):
        """
        Handles the authentication event.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        access_token: str
            The access token obtained after successful authentication.
        refresh_token: str
            The refresh token used to renew the access token when it expires.
        """
        print(f'access_token={access_token}\nrefresh_token={refresh_token}')
    
    @client.event
    async def on_ready():
        """
        Handles the client ready event.
        """
        print('PogU')
        
    @client.event
    async def on_follow(data: eventsub.channels.FollowEvent):
        """
        Handles the follow event.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        data: eventsub.channels.FollowEvent
            The event data containing information about the new follower.
        """
        # Send a message to the channel chat announcing the new follower.
        await client.channel.chat.send_message(f'{data["user_name"]} has followed the channel!')
    
    # Start the client and begin processing events.
    # This method should be called to start the event loop and handle incoming events.
    client.run()
    
    ```

=== "Bot"

    ???+ tip
        After authentication, make sure to store the received `access_token` and `refresh_token`
        for future use. Storing these tokens eliminates the need for reauthorization.

    ```python
    from twitch.ext.oauth import DeviceAuthFlow, Scopes
    from twitch.errors import Forbidden
    from twitch.user import Broadcaster
    from twitch.types import eventsub
    from twitch.ext.bot import Bot
    
    client = Bot(client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID', client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET')
    
    DeviceAuthFlow(
        client=client,
        scopes=[Scopes.USER_READ_EMAIL, Scopes.USER_READ_CHAT, Scopes.USER_WRITE_CHAT, Scopes.USER_MANAGE_WHISPERS]
    )
    
    
    @client.event
    async def on_code(code: str):
        """

        Handles the event after successful authentication, providing access and refresh tokens.
        """
        print(f'access_token={access_token}\nrefresh_token={refresh_token}')
    
    
    @client.event
    async def on_ready():

        Handles the event when a new user registers as a broadcaster.
        """
        info = await broadcaster.get_info()
        print(info['display_name'], 'has registered!')
        # Additional custom events can be added here for post-registration actions.
